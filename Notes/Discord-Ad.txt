__**Pokémon Iolite & Amethyst**__

__**Setting**__
Pokémon Iolite brings you to the cold region of Nordra, located just Northeast of Kalos,
you won't be travelling far to reach this new region to explore. There appears to
be an abundance of Dragon-Type and Ice-Type Pokémon in Nordra. You will also meet Team
Glacier, an evil group of warriors bent on destroying the Dragon Type as a whole.

Pokémon Amethyst introduces the Niphos Region, a beautiful region with a rich history
and diverse Pokémon to catch. The Type spread is also a lot more diverse here than
in Nordra. The Region's Professor, Professor Olive, tasks you with obtaining every
Regional Variant to aid his research in Environmental Adaption.

__**Features!**__
• Generation 1 through 8 Pokémon are included and obtainable.
• The Fairy-Type.
• Regional Variants.
• Mega Evolution.
• Z-Moves.

• Moves and Abilities from Generations 1 through 8.
• Two entirely new Regions, each with a large array of new Pokémon to discover.
The Region you start in will depend on which version you are playing, with the
opposite region being the Post Game.
• Mystery Gifts give you Items that start events instead the game just
giving you the Pokémon (Exceptions include promotional Pokémon).
• A COMPLETE overhaul of ALL Shiny Pokémon.
